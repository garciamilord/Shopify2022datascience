# Question 1
On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis. 

#### a. Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data. 
 
   > shop_id 42 has 17 orders from user_id 17 for $704,000 each which skew the mean.
    A better way to evaluate the data would be to use the median as the AOV.
    
#### b. What metric would you report for this dataset?Â¶
   > The median is the metric I would use to report for thid dataset.

#### c. What is its value?
   > It's value to report for AOV on this dataset is $284.00.

# Question 2

   > 54
#### b. What is the last name of the employee with the most orders?
   > Peacock
